# NeonGames, VideoGames E-Commerce

## Info
NeonGames is a VideoGames E-Commerce that uses RAWG API to get info on videogames titles.  
The stack used for this project includes React - React Router - TypeScript - Vite - TailwindCSS.  
The original idea was to develop a Simulation of an E-commerce and see how I can make a Cart works inside of it.  
Things and ideas quickly get out of hands and I developed a full online store for selling videogames.  
(although real purchases can't be made of course!)  

## Development
As I said previously, the stack used consist in React - React Router - TypeScript - Vite - TailwindCSS.  
Additional libraries where used in the development of this project:  

- Axios for better API fetching usage;
- SwiperJS for the amazing carousels and sliders used;
- Fluid Tailwind for some responsive design helpful classes;
- React-icons for the heavy icon usage;
- material-ui for some components styling;
- framer-motion for the animation usage;

In addition a DRY methodology was used for the components re-use, while also trying to keep my project folder organized as well.   
TypeScript was really helpful in this project as it let me spot all the bug in the fetching and Context API usage in advance.
